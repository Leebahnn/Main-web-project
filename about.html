                            I'm a Dutch Ethiopian, and have also lived in France where I have studied litterature as a degree.<br>
                            After many other jobs outside the IT world I decided to get into coding.
                            I discovered <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/"><span class="codenation">Codenation</span></a> 
                    
                            through the internet and got lucky to be part of a 3 week course in web-development.<br>
                            My main motivation is that we are in a digital era and I want to be part of this.</p>
